Goal
Build your product using HTML & CSS.

Targets
Code 3 pages of the prototype (homepage and 2 others) in HTML/CSS. The website-pages should mimic your original design as closely as possible, that way we know that you are able to translate a given design into a working prototype or not
Use the correct html tags
Style these html tags using css
Neat css structure with correct use of css specificity
Are able to make a form in html
Know how to use css position (relative, absolute, fixed)
Use html and css to layout your page (Flexbox or Grid)
Understand and apply the basics of responsive webdesign (@media en rem)
Use at least 1 pseudo-class
Details
Entire website is contained within 1 folder that contains all your HTML & CSS.
compress this folder to a zip file -> name_firstname_product.zip and upload it here
home page should be called index.html
check the paths to pages (links) and all assets (.html, .css, .js files, images, etc...).
They should all be relative paths within this folder
no absolute paths!
I grade your website as it is. When I extract this zip file and open the index.html we should get a website that works out of the box, I won't rewrite your code to be able to test it:
I won't fix any of the above mentioned mistakes 
I won't fix html/css that does not display correctly on our screen/device
"But it worked on my computer" is no excuse.
Your website is build for the web and the web has many computers that aren't yours! 
Test on different devices computers/phones/tablets... (you can rent devices from promedialab) 
Test on different browsers
Test on different screen sizes
